## Requirements

The app should have the following capabilities:

1) An API endpoint that given a number N, generates an ADN sequence of length N (ADN sequence consists of base pairs in the subset [G-A-T-C])
2) An API endpoint that given a potential sub-sequence tells if it is contained in the generated sequence
3) An API endpoint that given a number m returns the most frequent sub-sequence of length m contained in the generated sequence
